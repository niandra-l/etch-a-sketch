# Etch-a-sketch

This assignment was a part of The Odin Project course.

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

It allowed me to practice:
- use of functions and event listeners;
- DOM manipulation skills;
- styling skills and use of Flexbox;
- searching the web for new JavaScript methods.

The objectives of the project:
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Create the divs using JavaScript - don’t  making them by hand with copy and pasting in the HTML file or using CSS grid
3. Put the grid squares inside a “container” div (which goes directly in the HTML)
4. Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as grid
5. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid
